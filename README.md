# This project is still a work‑in‑progress!

_**Book Tracker**_ is a personal side-project that serves two purposes:
- A fun coding exercise
- A custom, local tool for managing the books I’ve already read and the ones I’d like to read (yes, I read a lot)
 
You can read some of my design notes [here](https://github.com/MarTorrijos/book-tracker/blob/main/docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md)
